An introduction to my personal blog. This is a place for short discussions about things I'm passionate about such as my hobbies, work and travel.

### What to expect?

Firstly, I'd like to publish some of the guides I've written for reference if I ever need to setup something from scratch.
For example, from time to time I switch VPS providers and have to setup a linux server from scratch, this could be valuable to someone else that's also looking to host. For example, this entire site is self hosted on an AWS Lightsail instance running a Debian 12 OS. If this is interesting to you, stay updated.

Also, I'm ecstatic to share my journey in Software Development, I think it could help others early into their career make the right choices and hopefully smooth out the bumps and turns along the way. There's a lot of studying and preparation required for success in either a degree or your first job, and there are many ways to make that easier.

Lastly, I'd like to display one of my oldest hobbies, FPV quadcopter racing. Funnily enough, it is the area that inspired me to pursue software development seriously. One of my first projects was learning how to program Arduinos in College. When I discovered quadcopter drones are simply little computers running flight controller firmware, I knew I had to build one!
I'd like to share that process, of building a quadcopter from components and developing and installing the firmware required to make them fly.
