# Who am I?

I'm just some guy on the internet.

I'm passionate about my career in Software Engineering and I aim to use my abilities to develop highly scalable, efficient and reliable systems used by millions. I'm currently an engineer at bet365.com where we deliver live odds, fixture and market data to the site 24/7/365.

# What is this website?

This is mostly a personal blog, however I intend to share my journey in the software development industry and a continuation of that career into more involved roles such as system design and architecture.
